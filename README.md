# sql-with-mysql

We want to get better at SQL. Structured Query Language (SQL) is the common factor in many relational database management systems (RDBMS), lets just call them databases for now. Examples of such databases are Microsoft SQL Server and MySQL. In this little adventure we are going to use MySQL because it is open source.

## Does SQL differ from database to database?

To my understanding as of right know (as a beginner), SQL for the most part is the same from database to database, but there are differences here and there. Read more about it here: http://troels.arvin.dk/db/rdbms/

## This project

I'am going to install MySQL and following along 2 courses using the command prompt, trying to note in this read me as I go. If time permits we might also build a little node api querying the database.
